  <p class="intro"> In the 11th century, a prominent Persian scholar named Ibn Sina (Avicenna) introduced the first example of multilinear chromatic theory in the Islamic world. His adaptation was based off the original concept of a single linear system developed by Aristotle. While the Aristotelian model only produced a single hue scale that ran from white to black, the model Ibn Sina developed explored three different methods of turning white to black. He was also the first scholar to claim that light had a speed and theorized the concept of a photon.</p>

  <p class="words"> In the 13th century, another Islamic scholar by the name of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (al-Tusi) developed a more complex color scale that built off of the original model by Ibn Sina.<br> Researchers' attempts to translate the writings of both al-Tusi and Ibn Sina revealed a strong connection between particular colors and 
  the surrounding ecology of the region.<sub>2</sub> In particular, many colors are named after plants in which they naturally occur. <sub>4</sub> It is also important to consider that in the Arabic language, the color and an object maintain independent existences. For example, اللون الأبيض (white color) vs. أبيض (white as an adjective) <sub>7</sub>
